To install classic, simply use the following command:

sudo snap install classic --beta --devmode


At this point, we have a ROS node created that will drive our robot as requested in a “command” message. 
It uses GPIO though, which still requires sudo. Instead of trying to get our workspace working using sudo, 
let’s temporarily change the permissions of GPIO so that we don’t need sudo (this will be reset upon reboot):

$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/gpiomem

install i2c:

sudo apt install i2c-tools

Create an I2C usergroup, apply it to the bus and add your user to this group:

sudo groupadd i2c (group may exist already)

sudo chown :i2c /dev/i2c-1 (or i2c-0)

sudo chmod g+rw /dev/i2c-1

sudo usermod -aG i2c *INSERT YOUR USERNAME*

Log out and log in. I was connected via VS code's SSH extension and needed to reboot. Then retry:

i2cdetect -y 1
